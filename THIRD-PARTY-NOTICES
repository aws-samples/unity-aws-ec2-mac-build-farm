1. Background
1.1
The Unity Asset Store (“Unity Asset Store”) is owned and operated by Unity Technologies ApS (company no. 30 71 99 13), Niels Hemmingsens Gade 24, 1153 Copenhagen K, Denmark ("Unity"). Your use of the Unity Asset Store is governed by a legal agreement between you and Unity consisting of these Asset Store Terms of Service ("Terms") which you accept by checking the box indicating your acceptance of these Terms and/or  registering as a user of the Unity Asset Store with a Unity ID or otherwise and the Controller-Controller Data Protection Addendum for Unity Asset Store found here.

1.2
In addition any Asset that you license from the Unity Asset Store that has been developed by Unity or that has been made available by third-parties ("Providers") that are not affiliated with Unity, will be subject to Unity's standard Unity Asset Store End User License Agreement ("EULA"), which is Appendix 1 to these Terms and which you accept as an integrated part of these Terms by checking the box indicating your acceptance of these Terms and/or registering as a user of the Unity Asset Store with a Unity ID or otherwise. Certain Assets may be governed by a Provider end user license agreement.

1.3
You may use Unity Asset Store to browse, locate, and download Assets (defined as (i) software designed in order to facilitate the development of electronic applications and digital media; and (ii) content (for example – without limitation – computer graphics, including 3D computer graphics, sounds and music), tutorials and other digital materials created in order to become incorporated and embedded components of electronic applications and digital media). Some of these Assets may be offered by Unity while others may be made available by Providers. You agree that Unity is not responsible for any Asset on the Unity Asset Store that originates from a source other than Unity. Additionally, some Assets may be made available to you at no charge while other Assets may be purchased for a fee. You agree that you are solely responsible for all fees associated with purchases you make on the Unity Asset Store.

2.2
Unity may make available to you various payment processing methods to facilitate the purchase of Assets from the Unity Asset Store.

2.3
From time to time, Unity may discover an Asset on the Unity Asset Store that violates the Asset Store Provider Agreement between a Provider and Unity or other legal agreements, laws, regulations or policies.

In addition, Unity shall itself be entitled to edit and make changes in the Asset. Finally, Unity shall be entitled to remove the Asset from the Unity Asset Store immediately, or reclassify the Asset at its sole discretion. Unity reserves the right to suspend and/or bar any Provider from the Unity Asset Store at its sole discretion.

By installing these Assets, you agree to such automatically requested and received Updates. The Asset Store may make connections to remote servers to provide Unity with anonymous usage statistics collected by service providers that Unity uses to improve the Asset Store. The Asset Store may also have features that confirm your compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

6. Indemnifications

#Appendix 1

Asset Store End User License Agreement

1. Parties to the Agreement/The Subject Matter of the Agreement
1.1
This Unity Asset Store End User License Agreement (“EULA”) is a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement between any individual or a single entity (“END-USER”) that acquires a license to an Asset from the Unity Asset Store and either (a) Unity Technologies ApS (company no. 30 71 99 13), Niels Hemmingsens Gade 24, DK-1153 Copenhagen K, Denmark ("Unity"); or, as the case may be (b) any third party (“Provider”) that offers and distributes its Assets via the Unity Asset Store. Consequently, this EULA shall apply regardless of whether a purchased Asset is produced by Unity or by a Provider (each, a "Licensor"). This EULA is therefore a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement as the case may be between either (i) Unity and END-USER (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Unity), or (ii) Provider and END-USER (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Provider).

1.2
By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or otherwise using the Assets, END-USER agrees to be bound the provisions of this EULA. All definitions of the Terms shall also apply in this EULA unless the context clearly provides for a different understanding.

1.3
The subject matter of this EULA is the licensing to END-USER of any Assets from Licensor via the Unity Asset Store. The Assets are licensed, not sold.

1.4
END USER hereby acknowledges that in the event it acquires a license to an ASSET which in the Unity Asset Store is marked as an Asset which is distributed by Provider (as opposed to Unity), then Provider shall be considered as the Licensor of, such Asset and; consequently, only Provider (as opposed to Unity) shall be responsible for any liability whatsoever under any EULA or any breach by Provider, including (without limitation) liability for infringement of any intellectual property rights, irrespective of the fact that Unity facilitates payment.

2. END-USER's Rights and Obligations
2.1
END-USER may use the licensed Assets only for their intended purpose.

2.2
2.2.1 Non-Restricted Assets. The following concerns only Assets that are not Restricted Assets: Subject to the restrictions set forth in this EULA, Licensor hereby grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset solely:

(a) to incorporate the Asset, together with substantial, original content not obtained through the Unity Asset Store, into an electronic application or digital media that has a purpose, features, and functions beyond the display, performance, distribution, or use of Assets (“Licensed Product”) as an embedded component of that Licensed Product, such that the Asset does not comprise a substantial portion of the Licensed Product; 

(b) to reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, and distribute the Asset as incorporated and embedded in that Licensed Product; 

(c) to incorporate the Asset into physical advertising materials and reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit and distribute the Asset as incorporated into those materials solely for marketing purposes with respect to the Licensed Product; 

(d) monetize the Asset within and for use within a Licensed Product, including via in-app purchases; and

(e) except as set forth in 2.2.1.1 below, modify the Assets in connection with (a), (b), (c), and (d).

 

 

2.2.1.1 Limitations on License.  Without limiting the foregoing, END-USER may not, and has no right to, 

 

(a) share the costs related to purchasing an Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Asset (forum pooling), 

(b) enable a customer or user of a Licensed Product to sell, transfer, distribute, lease, or lend the Assets for commercial gain or commercialize Assets within a Licensed Product, 

(c) without express authorization, monetize an Asset in a Licensed Product where the Licensed Product’s primary purpose is to create user-generated content, 

(d) use, reproduce, duplicate, publicly display, publicly perform, copy, modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works of, distribute, transfer, license, sublicense, rent, lease, lend, sell, trade, resell, or otherwise commercialize or monetize any Asset except as expressly permitted in this EULA.  

(e) if the Asset is a software development kit (“SDK”), modify the SDK except as instructed or authorized by Provider in writing (including instruction or authorization in Asset documentation) or include the SDK within END-USER’s Licensed Product at runtime.

(f) without express authorization, use Assets in any digital representation of value, ownership, or contractual rights.

 

2.2.2 Restricted Assets. The following concerns only Restricted Assets: Restricted Assets have license terms different from other Assets. Those license terms are found in the materials accompanying Restricted Assets ("Restricted Asset Terms"). For clarity, to the extent Restricted Asset Terms are different from this EULA, the Restricted Asset Terms will control; otherwise, this EULA will continue to apply. No other use is licensed or permitted and END-USER may otherwise not use, reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease or lend Restricted Assets. Without limitation of the foregoing it is emphasized that END-USER shall not be entitled to share the costs related to purchasing a Restricted Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Restricted Asset (forum pooling).

2.3
2.3.1 EXCEPT FOR EXTENSION ASSETS, END-USER is granted a license to install and use Assets on an unlimited number of computers provided that these computers belong to END-USER. If END USER chooses a “multi-entity” tier for an Asset, this license grant will extend to any Affiliate of END USER, where “Affiliate” means, with respect to END USER, any entity that directly or indirectly Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with END USER, where “Control,” “Controlled by,” and “under common Control with” mean possession, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, of the power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies of a person, whether through ownership of equity, voting, or other interests; “Affiliate” will also include any Contractor of END USER, provided that such Contractor’s use is limited to work on the project for which Contractor is hired by END USER.

2.3.2 END-USER is granted a single seat license to install and use any Asset categorized in the Asset Store as an "Editor Extension" “Scripting”, or  “Services” (collectively, “Extension Asset”) only on a maximum of 2 computers. For the avoidance of doubt, Extension Assets are licensed on a per seat basis and may not be shared or used concurrently on more than 2 different computers. As an exception, build farm servers and virtual machine instances used only for running, testing, or building projects with Extension Assets do not require separate seat license(s) or constitute use on more than 2 different computers.  

2.4
An END-USER may use an Asset under SECTIONS 2.2 and 2.3, and may have a third party, including any “work-made-for-hire” contractor or “freelancer” (“Contractor”), work on that Asset on its behalf. However, except for any “multi-entity” Assets under Section 2.3.1, any Contractor working on a project for an END-USER must have license(s) to its own to the Asset, and, conversely, to use an Asset under SECTIONS 2.2 and 2.3, a person must have its own license to the Asset, regardless of whether a Contractor working on a project for that person had its own license to that Asset. For example, a person who is a Contractor must have a seat license for an Extension Asset, and the person who is hirer of the Contractor must have a seat license for that Extension Asset.   

2.5
Services SDKs: If END-USER downloads and integrates Services SDKs, END-USER may be required to accept a Licensor end user agreement and/or additional Licensor terms and conditions to use such services.

2.6
END-USER shall pay for the license to the Assets in accordance with the payment process provided in the Asset Store or otherwise indicated by the Asset Store. END USER shall provide customary billing and tax information such as name, billing address, credit card information and VAT number (for EU residents). END USER agrees to pay for all purchases hereby authorizes the collection of such amounts including applicable taxes by charging the credit card provided, either directly by Unity or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor; alternatively, payment may be made where available by redemption of valid credit(s) (credit(s)s are non-transferable) issued by the Asset Store or a third party payment processor. For clarity, your payment to Unity for an Asset will satisfy your payment obligation with regard thereto, regardless of whether or not the Asset is published by Unity or a third party and regardless of whether the payment is made directly or through a third party online payment processor. VAT numbers cannot be added or changed after the purchase is completed. If you are directed to a third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s Privacy Policy. Please review such third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.

2.7
Some components of Assets (whether developed by Unity or third parties) may also be governed by applicable open source software licenses. In the event of a conflict between the applicable EULA and any such open source licenses, the open source software licenses shall prevail with respect to those components.

2.8
You agree that no modification or use of those Assets shall (a) infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights, or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy; (b) violate, or encourage any conduct that would violate, any applicable law or regulation or would give rise to liability of any kind; (c) be fraudulent, false, misleading, or deceptive; (d) be defamatory, obscene, pornographic, vulgar, or offensive; (e) promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment, or harm against any individual or group; (f) promote violence or actions that are threatening to any other person; or (g) promote illegal or harmful activities or substances.

2.9
2.9.1 All sales are final and there shall be no refunds except as expressly provided in this EULA or as required by law.

2.9.2 On acceptance of END-USER orders for licenses to Assets, content will be immediately available for download. END-USERS expressly consent to the making available of that content immediately upon acceptance of orders. If END-USER is a resident of the European Union and purchases any license to any Asset, the right to withdraw from such purchase within 14 days of the date of purchase ("Cooling Off Period") may be available; however, this right of withdrawal will not apply where performance begins before the end of the Cooling Off Period. Therefore, END-USERS expressly agree and understand that if END-USER orders any license to any Asset, END-USER’s right of withdrawal is forfeited upon acceptance as performance begins immediately on acceptance.

2.9.3 You may request a refund from a Provider in the following circumstances:

         (a) within 2 weeks of purchase of a license to an Asset where,

(i) the Asset was not as advertised (including any demo made available);

(ii) the Asset is not compatible with the most recent official release of Unity and no information was provided at the Unity Asset Store to indicate that Asset is so incompatible; or

(iii) the Asset includes unauthorized intellectual property.

         (b) the Asset is removed from the Unity Asset Store within 4 weeks of purchase of a license to an Asset and,

                     (i) the Provider caused the removal; or

                     (ii) Unity removed the Asset because it is or is alleged to be defective, malicious, infringes intellectual property rights of another person, defames, violates a third party's right of publicity or privacy, or does not comply with applicable law.

2.9.4 Permitted refunds for any license purchased by redemption of valid credit(s) will be credited back to that credit account.  

2.10
In this EULA, “Restricted Asset” means any Asset licensed hereunder that is designated (on prior written approval from Unity) as a “Restricted Asset” in any materials accompanying the Asset.

3. Licensor’s Rights and Obligations
Licensor shall render support services to END-USER only in the event a special agreement to this effect has been entered into.

4. Termination
4.1
Without prejudice to any other rights, Licensor may terminate this EULA if END-USER fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA and the Terms.

4.2
END-USER may terminate END-USER’s license at any time.

4.3
In the event that Unity at its discretion or as a result of a decision made by any competent court or authority makes a refund to END-USER of the fees paid for any Asset, then this EULA shall terminate for such Asset.

4.4
In the event of termination of this EULA, all license rights granted herein terminate and END-USER shall immediately destroy any and all copies of the Assets contained on any type of media under the control of END-USER and confirm such destruction in writing to LICENSOR.

5. Duplication Rights/Back Up Copy
5.1
END-USER may not make copies of the Assets, except incidental transient or temporary copies or otherwise to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted under mandatory statutory applicable law. In addition, Licensor acknowledges that copies of the Assets may be made when the Assets have been integrated as components of electronic applications and digital media as permitted hereunder.

5.2
After installation of one copy of the Asset pursuant to this EULA, END USER may keep the original copy of the Asset solely for back-up or archival purposes.

6. Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly
END USER may modify Assets. END USER shall not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble Services SDKs, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted under mandatory statutory applicable law.

7. Trademarks
This EULA does not grant END-USER any rights in connection with any trademarks or service marks of Licensor, Provider or Licensor's other suppliers.

8. Upgrades and Support
8.1
